    "Ans: Numpy Array - It is a type of multi-dimensional data structure in Python which can store objects of similar data types. The elements of the array are indexed by non-negative or positive integers. It is mutable. Arrays are a lot useful for performing mathematical operations on vectors.\n",

A DataFrame has labeled axes in the form of rows and columns. DataFrames are useful tools in data pre-processing as it provides useful methods for data handling."
