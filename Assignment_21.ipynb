    "Ans: A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. These factors include the distribution's mean (average), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.\n",

    "one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The difference between true random number generators(TRNGs) and pseudo-random number generators(PRNGs) is that TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers (like atmospheric noise), and PRNGs use mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated). pseudo-random number are good enough because we usually don't need true randomness for most applications. What We need is unpredictability. If we're using a random number generator in a game, we don't care if the numbers are truly random; we only care that they aren't predictable."
