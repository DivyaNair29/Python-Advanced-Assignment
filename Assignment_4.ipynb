    "\n",
    "Ans: Python provides the operator x += y to add two objects in-place by calculating the sum x + y and assigning the result to the first operands variable name x. We can set up the in-place addition behavior for our own class by overriding the magic “dunder” method iadd(self, other) in our class definition."

    "Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class. Hence when we have to extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning we can use operator overloading,"
