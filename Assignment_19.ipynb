    "partnership, for example?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class - it's a concrete 'thing' that you made using a specific class. So, 'object' and 'instance' are the same thing, but the word 'instance' indicates the relationship of an object to its class. a single object of a class can access multille functions defiend in the class in form of ine to many relationships."
