    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming. The main purpose of OOPs is to bind the data and functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data."

    "\n",
    "Ans. The main difference between class object and instance object is that class objects represent the class itself, while instance objects represent individual instances of the class. The class objects can have class-level attributes and methods that are shared among all instances of the class, while instance objects have their own set of attributes and methods that are independent of other instances of the same class."
