    "\n",
    "Ans: An abstract superclass in Python is typically created to declare a set of methods that must be created in any child class built on top of this abstract superclass. "

    "Ans: When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement they are considered as class attributes and can be used by functions inside a class or can be called by reating a class object."

    "\n",
    "Ans:  In python to override a method provided by an ancestor class, we have to decide if and when to call its original implementation. This gives the programmer the freedom to decide whether they need to just augment a method or to replace it completely."
