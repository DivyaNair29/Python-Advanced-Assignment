    "Q1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: A class-based exception can either cancel the current context or allow for a resume. Exceptions are raised using the statement RAISE EXCEPTION and handled using CATCH in a TRY control structure. Class-based exceptions can be raised in any procedures and can be further propagated by any procedures. A common class based and user defined exception in a single program as shown in preious assignments can be division by zero."

    "\n",
    "Ans:  The obsolete AccessError exception has been deleted. Because it is possible (although unlikely) that this change broke existing code, the Python interpreter can be invoked the command line option -X to disable this feature, and use string exceptions like before. This option is a temporary measure - eventually the string-based standard exceptions will be removed from the language altogether."
